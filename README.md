# Heroes App

link production: https://heroesaplicationsotacode.netlify.app/

The principal goal of this project is learn about react router v6, this include navigate between pages, private routes and public routes.

In this web application i try to apply correctly hooks how "useContext", "useReducer" and "useState", but i doesn't implement "useMemo" and "useEffect" for simplicty.
